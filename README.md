In this interactive web app, I first allow people to enter the URL of their business, which creates a group in which other employees of the company can add their profiles.
Part 2 of the app allows people to enter personal information for their profiles, including name, persponal gender pronouns, a URL of their particular website, and location - ideally submitting it to the database where it can be added to the broader company page. 

I was able to make the 1st part of the app work - in which the company URLS are stored. 
However, I had trouble making the second part work because MySQL was being too fragile. I accidentally ended up using a more advanced version of SQL but it didn't really help - I was just desperate to try to make anything work. 

To make this more functional, I would make the tables work for part 2 by fixing the disconnect between the tables that the app tries to make and whether they correspond to the tables on a SQL database, and make the part that displays the table work, but I couldn't get it to work after several days since the SQL would always break down eventually.
